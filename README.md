# MyVidious

A reverse proxy for the invidious API, but with added features. Most notably it can expose several different API endpoints that whitelists what channels can show up in recommended videos. 

Since MyVidious exposes APIs that are compatible with the invidious API, apps that work with the invidious API will also work with MyVidious (FreeTube on desktop, Yattee on iOS, Clipious on Android).
